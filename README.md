## 3. Historical Data Update for Item Type and Finance Head

To ensure consistency across your data, we updated your old data by fetching the **Item Type** from the **DB** sheet where it was available in the Item Master. The data was then transferred to the **PO Database** sheet, including both the Item Type and Finance Head columns.

## 4. Data Migration to IMP PO and Factory GRR Database

From the **PO Database**, the data was migrated to the IMP Range of the **IMP PO** sheet. We updated the **Item Type** column and added the **Finance Head** in the Factory GRR Database. This data was then transferred to the **IMP Factory GRR Database** in Tally Purchase, ensuring that both on-site and factory GRR databases are up-to-date with the new columns.
