Data Warehouse and Databricks Medallion Architecture Documentation

This documentation provides a professional and comprehensive guide to Data Warehouse Development/Deployment and the Databricks Medallion Architecture. It is designed for new joiners to understand the flow of data, layers, and their purposes in a Data Warehouse or Databricks ecosystem.

1. Data Warehouse Structure

Source Layer

Purpose: Collect data from various sources.

Data Characteristics: Raw, structured, semi-structured, or unstructured, often in string format.

Example:
Data from sources like APIs, databases, IoT devices, or flat files is collected in its original format, without transformation.


Import Layer

Purpose:

Ingest daily data from the source into the system.

Maintain the raw format for integrity and audit purposes.


Process:
Data is ingested directly without initial processing.

Example:
| Date       | Transaction_ID | Customer_Name | Transaction_Amount | Status  |
|------------|----------------|---------------|---------------------|---------|
| 2024-11-20 | TXN123         | John Doe      | "200"              | "Valid" |


Stage Layer

Purpose:

Transform data into the required structure.

Remove outliers and handle null or invalid values.


Process:

Data cleaning: Remove unnecessary or inconsistent data.

Data typing: Convert string data to appropriate types (e.g., integer, float, datetime).


Example Transformation:

Remove invalid rows (e.g., rows with "null" Transaction_Amount).

Convert Transaction_Amount from string to float.


Before Stage Layer:
| Date       | Transaction_ID | Customer_Name | Transaction_Amount | Status  |
|------------|----------------|---------------|---------------------|---------|
| 2024-11-20 | TXN124         | Jane Smith    | "null"             | Invalid |

After Stage Layer:
| Date       | Transaction_ID | Customer_Name | Transaction_Amount | Status  |
|------------|----------------|---------------|---------------------|---------|
| 2024-11-20 | TXN123         | John Doe      | 200.0              | Valid   |


Stage Ria (Production Stage)

Purpose: Store cumulative data (historical + daily).

Process: Append daily cleaned and transformed data from the Stage Layer into the cumulative dataset.

Example:
Stage Layer (Todayâ€™s Data):
| Date       | Transaction_ID | Customer_Name | Transaction_Amount | Status  |
|------------|----------------|---------------|---------------------|---------|
| 2024-11-20 | TXN125         | Mike Ross     | 300.0              | Valid   |

Stage Ria (Cumulative Data):
| Date       | Transaction_ID | Customer_Name | Transaction_Amount | Status  |
|------------|----------------|---------------|---------------------|---------|
| 2024-11-19 | TXN124         | Jane Smith    | 150.0              | Valid   |
| 2024-11-20 | TXN125         | Mike Ross     | 300.0              | Valid   |

2. Databricks Medallion Architecture

The Databricks Medallion Architecture is a modern data lakehouse structure with three layers: Bronze, Silver, and Gold. It ensures scalability, quality, and usability of data. Below is a detailed explanation of each layer with examples.


---

Datalake (Raw Zone)

Purpose:

Store raw data from source systems in its original format.

Handle structured, semi-structured, or unstructured data.


Analogy:
Imagine a Data Lake as a large warehouse where you dump all boxes of goods from different suppliers.



---

Bronze Layer

Purpose:

Serve as a landing zone for raw, unprocessed data.

Maintain raw data without any transformations.


Key Characteristics:

No schema enforcement.

Ideal for auditing and as a system of record.


Example:
Raw logs from an IoT device:

{"sensor_id": "123", "temp": "25C", "timestamp": "2024-11-20T12:00:00Z"}
{"sensor_id": "124", "temp": "null", "timestamp": "2024-11-20T12:05:00Z"}

Analogy:
The Bronze Layer is like an area in a warehouse where you unload boxes without organizing them, keeping their original packaging intact.



---

Silver Layer

Purpose:

Cleanse, conform, and standardize data from the Bronze Layer.

Enable self-service analytics and ad-hoc reporting.


Process:

Deduplicate records.

Remove invalid rows and standardize formats.

Join data with other sources (if needed).


Example Transformation:
Bronze Layer Data:

{"sensor_id": "123", "temp": "25C", "timestamp": "2024-11-20T12:00:00Z"}
{"sensor_id": "124", "temp": "null", "timestamp": "2024-11-20T12:05:00Z"}

Silver Layer Data:
| Sensor_ID | Temperature (C) | Timestamp           |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| 123       | 25.0             | 2024-11-20 12:00:00 |

Analogy:
In the Silver Layer, you open the boxes from the warehouse, remove defective items, and organize the rest for easy access.



---

Gold Layer

Purpose:

Provide aggregated, business-ready data for reporting and dashboards.

Used by BI teams for insights and advanced analytics.


Example:
Silver Layer Data (Cleaned IoT data):
| Sensor_ID | Temperature (C) | Timestamp           |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| 123       | 25.0             | 2024-11-20 12:00:00 |

Gold Layer Data (Average Temperature Report):
| Date       | Average Temperature (C) |
|------------|--------------------------|
| 2024-11-20 | 25.0                    |

Analogy:
The Gold Layer is like assembling a final product using the organized goods, ready for distribution or sale.

3. Practical Workflow Integration

1. Ingest Daily Data:
Data is ingested from multiple sources (e.g., databases, IoT sensors, APIs) into the Datalake or Import Layer.


2. Raw Landing in Bronze:
Data is moved to the Bronze Layer for storage without processing.


3. Cleaning in Silver:
Data is cleaned, transformed, and standardized for analytics or downstream usage.


4. Aggregation in Gold:
Data is aggregated into business-ready datasets for reporting in tools like Power BI or Tableau.




---

4. Best Practices

Import/Bronze Layer:

Always preserve raw data for reprocessing and auditing.

Use Delta Lake for ACID transactions.


Stage/Silver Layer:

Deduplicate data and enforce schema validation.

Optimize data partitions for faster query performance.


Gold Layer:

Aggregate data based on business needs.

Maintain consistent formats for reporting.
