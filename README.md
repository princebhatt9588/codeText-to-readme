Databricks Medallion Architecture: A Data Engineer's Perspective

The Medallion Architecture in Databricks is a framework for organizing data into three layers: Bronze, Silver, and Gold, which ensures data quality, scalability, and reusability. It is especially useful for implementing modern data lakes or lakehouses, enabling efficient ETL pipelines, and driving data-driven decision-making. This documentation provides an overview, along with practical examples, focusing on the Bronze and Silver layers.

1. Overview of the Medallion Architecture

Bronze Layer:

Raw, unprocessed data ingested from multiple sources.

Minimal transformations, preserving the data in its original form.

Acts as the system of record.


Silver Layer:

Cleansed and transformed data from the Bronze layer.

Deduplicated, normalized, and enriched for business use cases.

Enables efficient querying and serves as the foundation for analytical models.


Gold Layer:

Aggregated, business-ready data.

Optimized for reporting, dashboards, and machine learning workflows.

2. Data Engineer's Role

Bronze Layer Responsibilities

Data Ingestion:

Extract data from diverse sources (e.g., APIs, databases, IoT devices).

Tools: Databricks Autoloader, Kafka, or Azure Data Factory.


Schema Handling:

Store semi-structured (e.g., JSON, Parquet) and unstructured data.

Maintain schema evolution for data flexibility.


Storage Format:

Use Delta Lake format for ACID transactions and versioning.



Example: Ingesting Data into the Bronze Layer

from pyspark.sql.functions import current_timestamp

# Read data from Kafka
bronze_df = spark.readStream \
    .format("kafka") \
    .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "server:port") \
    .option("subscribe", "topic") \
    .load()

# Add metadata and write to Delta table
bronze_df.withColumn("ingest_time", current_timestamp()) \
    .writeStream \
    .format("delta") \
    .option("checkpointLocation", "/bronze/checkpoints") \
    .start("/bronze/data")

Silver Layer Responsibilities

Data Cleaning:

Remove duplicates, filter invalid records, and standardize formats.


Transformation:

Apply business rules or enrich data with lookups.


Validation:

Ensure data consistency using constraints or expectations (e.g., via Databricks Delta Expectations).


Optimization:

Optimize data for downstream consumption (partitioning, indexing).



Example: Transforming Data in the Silver Layer

# Read data from Bronze Layer
bronze_data = spark.read.format("delta").load("/bronze/data")

# Perform cleaning and transformation
silver_data = bronze_data.filter("value IS NOT NULL") \
    .dropDuplicates() \
    .withColumn("processed_time", current_timestamp())

# Write to Silver Layer
silver_data.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").save("/silver/data")

3. Practical Example Workflow

Use Case: Building a Customer 360 View

1. Bronze Layer:

Ingest customer data from CRM and support ticketing systems in raw JSON format.

Example file:

{"customer_id": "123", "name": "John", "ticket": null}



2. Silver Layer:

Cleanse data:

Remove nulls.

Standardize formats (e.g., date formats, case normalization).


Enrich with additional details, such as joining loyalty program data.

Silver Output:

+-------------+---------+-----------------+------------+
| customer_id |  name   |    email        | ticket_cnt |
+-------------+---------+-----------------+------------+
| 123         | John    | john@example.com| 5          |
+-------------+---------+-----------------+------------+



3. Gold Layer:

Aggregate customer data for insights:

Total purchases, average ticket resolution time, etc.

5. Best Practices

Bronze Layer:

Preserve raw data for auditing.

Ensure idempotent data ingestion to handle reprocessing scenarios.


Silver Layer:

Use Delta Lake optimizations like Z-ordering for large datasets.

Implement robust data quality checks with tools like Great Expectations or custom validation.


General:

Leverage Databricks notebooks for collaborative ETL workflows.

Use CI/CD pipelines for deployment and monitoring.
