### **Thesis Topic 1: Predictive Analytics for Stock Market Trends Using Deep Learning**

**Short Description**: 
Leverage the power of deep learning models, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTM), to predict stock market trends. This research aims to improve the accuracy of stock price prediction models by incorporating sentiment analysis from financial news articles.

**Description about Dataset**:
- **Stock Prices Dataset**: Historical daily stock prices for various companies.
- **Financial News Dataset**: Collection of financial news articles associated with the companies in the stock dataset.
