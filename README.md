#### 4(a). Explainable AI (XAI):
Integrate explainability features into recommender systems to provide users with insights into how recommendations are generated. Transparent models foster trust and allow users to better understand and accept personalized suggestions.


#### 4(b). Multi-Modal Approaches:
Explore multi-modal approaches that incorporate both textual and visual information for a more comprehensive understanding of user preferences. This can involve processing user reviews, images, and other forms of user-generated content.


In conclusion, the literature review highlights the transformative role of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in advancing personalized recommender systems. From overcoming the limitations of collaborative filtering and content-based approaches, NLP has enabled a nuanced understanding of user preferences expressed in natural language. The incorporation of text representation techniques, sentiment analysis, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) has enhanced the system's ability to tailor recommendations based on individualized contexts. Despite persistent challenges such as the cold start problem and ambiguity in user intent, recent advancements in deep learning, particularly with transformer models, showcase promising strides towards more accurate and context-aware recommendations. As the field progresses, the fusion of multi-modal approaches and the integration of explainability features are anticipated to redefine the landscape of personalized recommender systems, providing users with more transparent and satisfying online experiences.
