The emergence of BCIs marks a pivotal moment in human-computer interaction, ushering in an era where direct communication between the brain and external devices is no longer a science fiction fantasy but a tangible reality. These interfaces, which capture and interpret electrical signals from the brain, have found applications ranging from assisting differently-abled individuals to facilitating immersive gaming experiences.

However, with the rise of AI, the potential applications of BCIs have expanded exponentially. Today's AI systems, powered by advanced machine learning algorithms and massive datasets, are capable of performing tasks that were once thought to be the exclusive domain of human cognition. Whether it's recognizing patterns in vast datasets, generating human-like text, or driving cars autonomously, AI is reshaping the technological landscape. In this context, BCIs offer a direct conduit for human-AI interaction, providing a channel through which humans can 'communicate' with AI systems and vice versa.

The richness of EEG data, which captures the electrical activity of the brain, provides a treasure trove of insights into human cognition. By analyzing this data, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of how the brain functions and how it interacts with external stimuli. In the realm of BCIs, EEG data can be used to decode the user's intentions, enabling them to control external devices using their thoughts alone. However, the non-stationary nature of EEG data, combined with its susceptibility to noise and artifacts, poses significant challenges for analysis and interpretation.

While BCIs have been around for several decades, their integration with AI is a relatively new frontier. Traditional BCIs relied on simple algorithms to decode brain signals, but the advent of AI has opened up new possibilities. Advanced machine learning algorithms, trained on vast datasets, can decode brain signals with unprecedented accuracy, paving the way for more sophisticated and intuitive BCIs. Moreover, AI can also assist in preprocessing and cleaning EEG data, addressing challenges related to noise and artifacts.

The convergence of BCIs and AI also raises several ethical and philosophical questions. As we move towards a future where humans and AI systems interact more closely, issues related to privacy, autonomy, and agency come to the fore. For instance, if an AI system can decode a user's thoughts, what safeguards are in place to ensure that this information is not misused? Similarly, as BCIs become more integrated into our daily lives, questions about autonomy and agency arise. Who is in control, the user or the AI?

This thesis aims to explore these questions and more, delving deep into the world of BCIs and AI. Through rigorous research, analysis, and discussion, it seeks to shed light on the current state of the art, the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, and the broader implications of human-AI interaction through BCIs.
