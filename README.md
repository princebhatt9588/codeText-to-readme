### Title: Instructions for Data Extraction and Text Analysis

---

### 1. Approach to the Solution

The script orchestrates a sequence of operations geared towards data extraction from web pages and subsequent text analysis, pulling data from a predefined list of URLs stored in an Excel file. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the script's operations:

- **Mounting Google Drive**: To seamlessly access files stored on Google Drive directly from Google Colab, the script initiates by mounting the Google Drive. This is crucial for reading the input Excel file and storing the output directly onto the Drive.

- **Dependency Installation**: It installs essential Python packages such as `pandas` for data manipulation, and `nltk` for natural language tasks, ensuring all necessary libraries are available for the script to execute effectively.

- **Data Reading and Web Scraping**: The script fetches URLs from an Excel file and utilizes `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape web content from each URL. It meticulously handles HTTP errors, especially focusing on the 404 errors to omit URLs that are not found.

- **Text Processing**: Post scraping, the script extracts text and saves it into text files. It processes this text further by tokenizing, removing stopwords, and conducting sentiment analysis using pre-loaded lists of positive and negative words.

- **Analysis**: Various metrics such as positive scores, negative scores, polarity, subjectivity, sentence lengths, and syllable counts are calculated. These metrics are designed to provide insights into the textual complexity and sentiment.

- **Output**:
  - The script creates a DataFrame (`output_df`) populated with the calculated scores.
  - It removes rows with `URL_IDs` that resulted in a 404 error, ensuring data integrity.
  - All calculated metrics are incorporated into the DataFrame.
  - The resultant DataFrame is then saved as a CSV file named `Output_Data.csv` on Google Drive.

### 2. How to Run the .py File to Generate Output

Running this script is straightforward if you follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Environment**:
   - Ensure that your environment supports Python and has internet access. For local execution, Python should be installed on your system.

2. **Save the Script**:
   - Store the code into a new Python file, preferably named `script.py`.

3. **Set Up Google Drive (if using locally)**:
   - If you are running the script locally but want to use Google Drive for file storage, configure Google Drive mounting with tools like `google-drive-ocamlfuse` for Linux or Google's `Backup and Sync` for Windows/Mac.

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install all the required packages by running the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas==1.3.3 nltk requests beautifulsoup4 xlrd
     ```

5. **Run the Script**:
   - Launch the script from your command line or terminal:
     ```bash
     python script.py
     ```

6. **Check Outputs**:
   - After execution, verify the output directory on your Google Drive or local setup for the CSV file.

### 3. Include All Dependencies Required

The script depends on multiple external Python libraries. Make sure the following dependencies are installed:

- **pandas**: For DataFrame operations and Excel file interaction.
- **nltk**: For processing text, including tokenization and stopwords management.
- **requests**: To fetch web pages.
- **beautifulsoup4**: For parsing HTML and extracting data.
- **xlrd**: To read data from Excel files.

Installation command:
```bash
pip install pandas==1.3.3 nltk requests beautifulsoup4 xlrd
```

### Additional Notes

- Ensure that the paths to the input and output files are correctly set up according to your environment, whether it's local or on Google Drive.
- Regularly update the dependencies to ensure the script's compatibility and security.
