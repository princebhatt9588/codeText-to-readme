---

## **I. Python Basics**

### **1. Python Fundamentals**

- **Introduction to Python**: 
  Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

- **Python Syntax and Semantics**:
  - **Variables**: Containers for storing data values.
    ```python
    x = 5
    y = "Hello, World!"
    ```
  - **Data Types**: Integers, Floats, Strings, Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries.
    ```python
    num = 10            # Integer
    pi = 3.14           # Float
    name = "Alice"      # String
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]  # List
    person = ("John", 25)  # Tuple
    unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3}  # Set
    student = {"name": "Emma", "age": 20}  # Dictionary
    ```
  - **Operators**: Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), Comparison (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`), Logical (`and`, `or`, `not`), Assignment (`=`, `+=`, `-=`).
  - **Control Flow**: Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) and loops (`for`, `while`).
    ```python
    if x > 5:
        print("x is greater than 5")
    else:
        print("x is not greater than 5")
    
    for i in range(5):
        print(i)
    ```

- **Functions**:
  - **Defining Functions**: Reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.
    ```python
    def greet(name):
        return f"Hello, {name}!"
    
    print(greet("Alice"))
    ```
  - **Built-in Functions**: `len()`, `type()`, `print()`, etc.
  - **Lambda Functions**: Anonymous functions for simple, single-use cases.
    ```python
    square = lambda x: x * x
    print(square(4))  # Output: 16
    ```

### **2. Data Structures**

- **Lists**: Ordered, mutable collections of items.
  ```python
  my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  my_list.append(6)
  ```
- **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable collections of items.
  ```python
  my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
  ```
- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique items.
  ```python
  my_set = {1, 2, 3}
  my_set.add(4)
  ```
- **Dictionaries**: Unordered collections of key-value pairs.
  ```python
  my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
  print(my_dict["name"])
  ```

### **3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

- **Classes and Objects**:
  - **Class**: Blueprint for creating objects (instances).
  - **Object**: Instance of a class.
    ```python
    class Dog:
        def __init__(self, name, age):
            self.name = name
            self.age = age
        
        def bark(self):
            return "Woof!"
    
    my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)
    print(my_dog.bark())
    ```

- **Inheritance**: Creating a new class from an existing class.
  ```python
  class Animal:
      def __init__(self, name):
          self.name = name

  class Cat(Animal):
      def meow(self):
          return "Meow!"
  
  my_cat = Cat("Whiskers")
  print(my_cat.meow())
  ```

- **Encapsulation**: Restricting access to methods and variables to prevent data modification.
- **Polymorphism**: The ability to use a common interface for different data types.

### **4. Error Handling**

- **Try-Except Blocks**: Used to handle exceptions and errors gracefully.
  ```python
  try:
      print(10 / 0)
  except ZeroDivisionError:
      print("Cannot divide by zero")
  ```

## **II. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**

### **1. What is an API?**

- **Definition**: An API is a set of protocols and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

### **2. Types of APIs**

- **REST (Representational State Transfer)**: A style of architecture based on HTTP requests, including methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**: A protocol for exchanging structured information in web services, uses XML-based messaging.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs, provides a more flexible and efficient way to request data.

### **3. RESTful API Basics**

- **HTTP Methods**:
  - **GET**: Retrieve data from a server.
  - **POST**: Send data to a server to create/update a resource.
  - **PUT**: Update a resource on the server.
  - **DELETE**: Remove a resource from the server.

- **Endpoints**: URLs that represent the location where resources can be accessed.
  - **Example**: `https://api.example.com/users`

- **Status Codes**:
  - **200**: OK (Successful request)
  - **201**: Created (Resource created successfully)
  - **400**: Bad Request (Invalid request)
  - **401**: Unauthorized (Authentication required)
  - **404**: Not Found (Resource not found)
  - **500**: Internal Server Error (Server-side error)

- **Headers**: Used to pass additional information with an HTTP request or response.
  - **Common Headers**: `Authorization`, `Content-Type`, `Accept`

### **4. Working with APIs in Python**

- **Python Libraries for APIs**:
  - **Requests**: Simplifies making HTTP requests in Python.
    ```python
    import requests
    
    response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/users")
    print(response.status_code)
    print(response.json())
    ```

- **Authentication**: Securing API endpoints.
  - **API Keys**: Simple tokens that authenticate requests.
  - **OAuth**: Open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way to grant websites or applications limited access to user information.

## **III. Python Backend**

### **1. Introduction to Python for Backend Development**

- **Backend Development**: The server-side logic that powers websites and applications, focusing on databases, scripting, and the architecture of the server.

### **2. Web Frameworks**

- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed with simplicity and flexibility in mind.
  ```python
  from flask import Flask
  
  app = Flask(__name__)
  
  @app.route('/')
  def home():
      return "Hello, Flask!"
  
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run(debug=True)
  ```

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
  - **Features**: Built-in admin interface, ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), Authentication, and Middleware.

### **3. Creating RESTful APIs with Flask**

- **Basic API Creation**:
  ```python
  from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
  
  app = Flask(__name__)
  
  @app.route('/api/v1/hello', methods=['GET'])
  def hello_world():
      return jsonify({"message": "Hello, World!"})
  
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run(debug=True)
  ```

- **Handling HTTP Methods**:
  ```python
  @app.route('/api/v1/users', methods=['POST'])
  def create_user():
      data = request.get_json()
      return jsonify(data), 201
  ```

### **4. Database Integration**

- **SQLAlchemy**: SQL toolkit and ORM for Python. It provides a full suite of well-known enterprise-level persistence patterns.
  ```python
  from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
  
  app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///example.db'
  db = SQLAlchemy(app)
  
  class User(db.Model):
      id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
      username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
  
  db.create_all()
  ```

### **5. Authentication and Authorization**

- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. Commonly used for authentication.
  ```python
  from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager
  
  app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_jwt_secret_key'
  jwt = JWTManager(app)
  ```

## **Interview Questions and Answers**

### **Python Basics**

1. **What is Python?**
   - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

2. **Explain the difference between a list and a tuple.**
   - A list is an ordered, mutable collection of items that can be changed after creation, whereas a tuple is an ordered, immutable collection that cannot be changed after creation.

3. **What are

 Python decorators?**
   - Decorators are functions that modify the functionality of another function. They are used to add functionality to existing code in a reusable and clean manner.

4. **How does Python handle memory management?**
   - Python uses a combination of reference counting and garbage collection for memory management. Reference counting keeps track of the number of references to each object, and when the count drops to zero, the memory is freed. Garbage collection is used to detect and clean up cycles of references that are not reachable.

5. **What is the difference between `append()` and `extend()` in a list?**
   - `append()` adds a single element to the end of a list, while `extend()` adds multiple elements from another iterable to the end of a list.

6. **What is the purpose of the `self` keyword in Python?**
   - The `self` keyword represents the instance of the class. It is used to access variables that belong to the class and allows methods to modify the instanceâ€™s state.

7. **Explain the difference between `==` and `is` operators.**
   - `==` checks for value equality, meaning it checks if the values of two variables are the same. `is` checks for reference equality, meaning it checks if two variables point to the same object in memory.

8. **What is a lambda function in Python?**
   - A lambda function is a small anonymous function defined with the `lambda` keyword. It can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression.

9. **How can you handle exceptions in Python?**
   - Exceptions in Python can be handled using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks. The `try` block contains code that might raise an exception, the `except` block handles the exception, `else` executes code if no exceptions are raised, and `finally` executes code regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.

10. **What are list comprehensions in Python?**
    - List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a `for` clause, and optionally, `if` clauses.
    ```python
    squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
    ```

### **APIs**

1. **What is an API?**
   - An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols, routines, and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

2. **What is a RESTful API?**
   - A RESTful API is an API that follows the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer), which is an architectural style that uses HTTP requests to access and manipulate data.

3. **What are the HTTP methods commonly used in RESTful APIs?**
   - The common HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs are GET (retrieve data), POST (create data), PUT (update data), and DELETE (delete data).

4. **What is a status code in an API context?**
   - A status code is a three-digit number sent by a server in response to an HTTP request. It indicates the result of the request, with common codes including 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Internal Server Error).

5. **What is an endpoint in an API?**
   - An endpoint is a specific URL where an API can access resources and perform actions. It is essentially the location where the API's resources are exposed to the client.

6. **How does authentication work in APIs?**
   - Authentication in APIs verifies the identity of the client making the request. Common methods include API keys, OAuth tokens, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

7. **What is a JSON Web Token (JWT)?**
   - A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It is commonly used for authentication and data exchange.

8. **Explain the purpose of the `requests` library in Python.**
   - The `requests` library in Python is used to make HTTP requests to interact with APIs. It simplifies the process of sending requests and handling responses.

9. **What are headers in an HTTP request?**
   - Headers are key-value pairs sent in an HTTP request or response to provide additional information, such as content type, authorization, and caching instructions.

10. **What is the difference between SOAP and REST APIs?**
    - SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services using XML, whereas REST is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods and formats like JSON or XML for data exchange.

### **Python Backend**

3. **How can you create a basic route in Flask?**
   - In Flask, a route can be created using the `@app.route()` decorator, followed by defining a function that returns the response.
   ```python
   from flask import Flask
   
   app = Flask(__name__)
   
   @app.route('/')
   def home():
       return "Hello, Flask!"
   ```

4. **What is SQLAlchemy?**
   - SQLAlchemy is a SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. It provides a full suite of tools for database interaction and management.

5. **What is the purpose of middleware in web frameworks?**
   - Middleware is software that acts as an intermediary between two systems or components. In web frameworks, it is used to process requests before they reach the application logic and responses before they are sent to the client.

6. **How can you handle forms in Flask?**
   - Forms in Flask can be handled using the `request` object to access form data. Flask-WTF can also be used for form validation and security.
   ```python
   from flask import request
   
   @app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])
   def submit():
       username = request.form['username']
       return f"Hello, {username}!"
   ```

7. **What is a WSGI server?**
   - WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) is a specification for a simple and universal interface between web servers and web applications or frameworks written in Python. A WSGI server is software that implements this interface to serve web applications.

8. **Explain the use of `@app.route` in Flask.**
   - `@app.route` is a decorator in Flask used to define a route (URL) that the web application will respond to. It maps the URL to a specific function, which returns the response.

9. **How can you connect a Flask application to a database?**
   - A Flask application can be connected to a database using extensions like Flask-SQLAlchemy, which provides an ORM to interact with databases in a Pythonic way.

10. **What is the difference between a GET and a POST request?**
    - A GET request is used to retrieve data from a server and is idempotent, meaning it does not change the server's state. A POST request is used to send data to a server to create or update a resource, and it can change the server's state.
